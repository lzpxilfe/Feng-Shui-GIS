This file documents interpretation boundaries.

## Regional Notes

### Korea
- Better supported for settlement and architecture interpretation in historical context.
- Key references:
  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11355-006-0014-8
  - https://doi.org/10.15299/jk.2016.8.60.203
  - https://doi.org/10.1515/9781438468716-011
  - https://doi.org/10.1515/9781438468716-009

### China
- Strong conceptual geomancy literature exists, but plugin-ready modern GIS calibration references remain limited in this codebase.
- Current implementation uses East-Asia baseline + conservative bias settings.

### Japan / Ryukyu
- Ryukyu/Okinawa landscape form evidence is relatively concrete for village/tree-layout context.
- Key references:
  - https://doi.org/10.1163/156853508X276824
  - https://doi.org/10.1163/156853511X577475

## Period Notes

- `ancient`, `medieval`, `early_modern`, `modern` profiles are currently heuristic deltas.
- They are not yet learned from a large, period-labeled benchmark set.
- Use as exploratory priors, not definitive historical claims.

## Hard Constraint for Research Use

Any publication-grade interpretation must include local-site validation and uncertainty reporting.
