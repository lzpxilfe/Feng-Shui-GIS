## Regional Notes

### Korea
- Better supported for settlement and architecture interpretation in historical context.

### China
- Strong conceptual geomancy literature exists, but plugin-ready modern GIS calibration references remain limited in this codebase.
- Current implementation uses East-Asia baseline + conservative bias settings.
- Additional verified references:
  - GIS mausoleum suitability: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10110752

  - Parametric design influence: https://doi.org/10.1038/s40494-025-01686-y

### Japan / Ryukyu
- Ryukyu/Okinawa landscape form evidence is relatively concrete for village/tree-layout context.
- Key references:

## Period Notes

- `ancient`, `medieval`, `early_modern`, `modern` profiles are currently heuristic deltas.
- They are not yet learned from a large, period-labeled benchmark set.
- Use as exploratory priors, not definitive historical claims.

## Hard Constraint for Research Use

Any publication-grade interpretation must include local-site validation and uncertainty reporting.
